				<h2>Activity:</h2>
				<p><em>1. Has anyone ever told you that you have potential? Do you believe it? Why or why not?</em></p>
				<p>Many persons have told me I have potential and I've believed every one of them. Throughout my life I've
					seen myself grow in many facets that include professional and personal development. I think to have potential
					is to have the willingness to learn and constantly strive for goals that help me pursue my interests.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p><em>2. What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal? How can you overcome them?</em></p>
				<p>Internal factors can be self doubt and negative self talk. Those cross my mind from time to time. To overcome
					those types of talk is to talk it out with a person who is experienced in this field of study. It also helps
					to do self practices such as deep breaths, vision boards, and positive mantras. When it comes to external
					factors, my history with the judicial system comes to mind. As some employers conduct deep background checks,
					some opportunities my not be available for me and that's okay. Finding/creating other opportunities for myself is a
					way to overcome this obstacle. Location, in terms of collaboration with other Indigenous artists and entities is
					another external factor. The people I may want to work with may not be in this region so I may have to rely on using
					the Internet to connect with others via social media and/or email.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p><em>3. How do you create value for others?</em></p>
				<p>I help create value for others by providing them opportunities by utilizing the knowledge I possess and creating ideas from unique perspectives.
					I also help create value for others by offering my time to help with tasks which may need assistance. It shows character about
					someone when they are willing to help others out in order to build camaraderie and community.
