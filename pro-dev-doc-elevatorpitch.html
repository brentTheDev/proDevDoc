				<h2>Elevator Pitch:</h2>
				<p><em>Version 1</em></p>
				<p>Hello, I'm Brent. I create websites &amp; develop software with programming skills in various languages.
					As an Indigenous person, I understand how cultural values are at the center of Indigenous communities. Would
					you be interested in a collaboration where I can build a site for your new community engagement project?
				</p>
				<br>
				<p><em>Version 2</em></p>
				<p>Hello, I'm Brent. I use web design and the influence of my Indigenous heritage in the sites I create. I am
				looking to connect with other Indigenous artists for the possibilty of creating their own professional website.
				Do you know of any artists that are looking for a greater web presence?</p>
