				<h1>Weekly Reflection</h1>
				<h2>Week 3</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Wee 3 we busy AF. So much going on with Capstone and individual projects. We also had our 1st assessment.
					I felt really good about the work I put in on the assessment. All of my capstone team members showed up for the
					Angular crash. We spent about 4 hours learning how to set up an Angular project which was a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to the upcoming weeks ahead
					with the capstone project. I've been working closely with my project teammates and my career buddy. I see success
					in our future.
