						I had a lot of fun and enjoyed learning about my team during the time we played Forbidden Island. The
						first thing I took note from Dan was that he said we're a pensive group. I didn't know what that meant
						but it made me think about how analytical and highly thoughtful we were of our actions. Later on, I looked
						up the word pensive and Dan spoke true to the definition. I definitely like how we communicated and considered
						other during our turns. It showed how thoughtful we can be when it comes to making decisions that will
						affect the team as a whole. I think all of us definitely played off each others' strengths and helped
						another when feeling weak.. One thing I did mention to the team is that we should trust our gut feeling
						when it comes to our individual decision making. If we trust ourselves, we can more of a solid foundation
						of trust with the rest of the group. I think the group dynamic we have is awesome. All of us are participating
						in Angular Attack 2018. 3 of us will be on a team and 1 will be on Dylan's team. That right there says
						a lot about how we want to learn more and strive for tools to help future endeavors.
