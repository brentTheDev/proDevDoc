				<h1>Weekly Reflection</h1>
				<h2>Week 1:</h2>
				<br>
				<p>During week 1, we tied up a few loose ends with mySQL and jumped right into Object Oriented Programming.
					The instructor covered essential parts of an object, what a class is to an object, functions vs methods,
					encapsulation, accessor methods, mutator methods, exceptions, composition vs inheritance, and the use of
					Composer. In 2 groups, we performed a class activity to help us understand how classes work at a basic
					level. Through the end of the week, we were able to apply more concepts to our data design projects. This,
					in turn, helped with the understanding of how we will be using object oriented PHP in the upcoming days.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>During my time outside of normal instruction hours I was able to attend 3 events for both professional
					and personal development. Tuesday, April, 17th was the first evening of the optional TED Talk series that
					is offered by the instructor. The talk discussed about indexing keys in mySQL. This was good additional
					information realted to databases and something to look into for future projects. Thursday, April, 19th was
					a open house event for RSI. Rural Sourcing Inc. is a company that sources tech jobs & IT support through
					the US. This event, disguised as an open house, was actually a means of recruiting and reaching out to
					local developers for possibilities of employment. Friday, April, 20th, I joined a few classmates and
					attended a career fair hosted at EC Council in NE Albuquerque. Many tech companies along with partners
					were there with information about employment and other resources. The last 2 events were good for testing
					my networking skills the ability to discuss my skillset.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>As I chatted with my peers this week, I noticed how there was a common connection of feeling lost and/or
					confused about what is happening in the class. I think near the end of the week is when we were feeling
					confused in the next steps of our project. One thing I noticed at this point is that we all have our
					strengths and weaknesses in which we must share our knowledge to help others who might be having troubles
					in certain areas of study.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>I didn't order the headphones, but I really want to this week. I decided to hold off on the mouse purchase.
					I've also been looking into other peripherals for future use. It was a good week/weekend. Looking forward
					to week 2.
