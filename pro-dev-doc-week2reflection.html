				<h1>Weekly Reflection</h1>
				<h2>Week 2:</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Week 2 consisted of a combination of lecture and open work time. I think it was a good way to change up
					the routine for the class. Dylan covered a little more about OOP including contracts, PDOs, static methods/variables,
					namespacing, and autoloading. This content covered in those lectures helped me tie up the data design project
					I've been working since it was assigned on week 0. During this time, I was able to take note of my skill
					level among my peers. Some concepts were easier to graps than others and this is when I recognized who I
					could reach out to and seek guidance. Identifying my strengths and weaknesses early on will definitely help
					when it comes to working in our capstone groups.
				</p>

					On Tuesday, April 24, Dylan had his weekly TED Talk after class. The topic for this talk was setting up a
					virtual private network or VPN. He gave us resources to find a service that would suit our needs accordingly.
					He also offered insight on how to use a VPN in different use cases. Throughout the time of the talk, he
					did a step-by-step walkthrough of how he set up his current VPN. Thursday, April 26, I attended a Meetup
					hosted at RSI. This was a monthly meeting for AWS (Amazon Web Services) Meetup group. This month's topic
					was building a web application on a serverless database. Using FaaS, a local developer by the name of Luke
					gave the crowd a tutorial on how to incorporate serveless computing through the use of JetBrains WebStorm,
					the TypeScript programming language, and AWS. Although the technology and IDE were somewhat new to me, I
					was able to apply concepts learned in class to what was happening during Luke's tutorial. This goes to show
					that the knowledge gained in the bootcamp is applicable in a different setting. Friday, April 27, alongside
					a few of my cohort 20 peers, we attended a meeting for an upcoming hack-a-thon entitled "Angular Attack".
					We met up at Maya Cafe to discuss teams choices, info exchange, and to offer help. I decided to sign up for
					this hack-a-thon as part of professional development as well as a resume builder for future employment
					opportunities. The event is less than 2 weeks away and I know nothing about Angular. I'm looking forward to
					the challenge.
				</p>

					At the tail end of the week. We were able to narrow down ideas for capstone projects and get placed into
					our teams. The capstone projects revolve around beer, food trucks, and outdoor hiking trails. I was placed
					with Carlos, Erik, Daniel, and James. Today(4/29/2018), a majority of us were able to finalize the goals
					and vision for the project. Our group will be developing an application for enthusiasts and connoisseurs
					in the local ABQ beer scene. I think the group is a good collection of personalities and I'm looking forward
					to working on our project.
