				<h1>Weekly Reflection</h1>
					<h2>Week 0:</h2>
						<br>
						<p> I enjoyed the week getting to learn about my peers. Personalities are starting to show like
							turtles poking their heads out of their shell. I had a lot of fun working in the group setting.
							I feel like I am starting to learn how my role will develop as time progresses throughout the
							duration of the bootcamp.</p>
						<br>
						<p>The snap challenges are definitely a good measure of skill level for the class. I feel like I'm
							able to apply the learnings from lecture to completing the challenges. I may have missed a few
							questions, but I read documentation or found someone to help explain an answer. I wasn't confident
							when in my deployment skills for a bit. I was struggling with that for the first few days of
							instruction. I'm becoming more confident in some skills, but I also see where I need to improve.
							I'm excited to continue through these transitions.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I attended two events. On Tuesday, April 10th, I attended a Meetup hosted by Deep Dive Coding
							including a collaboration with a representative from Julia and a coworking facilty by the name of
							FreeRange. Jane from Julia talked the Julia programming language and it's features. A few tech guys
							from the local ABQ area attended as well as a few of my peers from the cohort. The second event on
							Thursday, April 12th, was hosted by Bernalillo County and the new Lobo Rainforest facility.
							Entitled "Colliding the Future", the concept was to figure how to bridge the connection between
							younger and older generations in the workforce. I met a few individuals who had some good words.</p>
						<br>
						<p>This weekend, I plan to continue to work on homework assignments and more code. I also hope to
							order some new headphones, a USB-C hub, and possibly a new mouse.</p>
